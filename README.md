## Prior knowledge required

To follow the tutorial you need the following prior knowledge:

- basic (functional) programming knowledge
- familiarity with the ML syntax or F# can help but is not a strict requirement

## Software Requirements

Please install the latest .NET SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

Verify that you can execute `dotnet fsi` to start the F# REPL and a simple `id 42` works as expected.

For coding F# we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ionide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) plugin, even though any other editor should suffice.
